PIV Engineering Guides are for engineers configuring agency infrastructure, servers, and enterprise applications for authentication. The guides are focused on U.S. federal government implementations. 

{% include alert-info.html heading="Are you trying to solve a problem?" content="Your colleagues have likely encountered or solved the same problem.  Engineering guides exist across government.  This site's purpose is to organize tips from agency engineers, help link to .gov or .mil information available, and provide a common site for collaboration." %}

You can find additional guides across agency websites by using a few simple methods: 

1. Search on the Internet: include the _server_ or _application_ or _topic_ and add "+PIV +CAC"
2. Search on the Internet: include the _server_ or _application_ or _topic_ and add "+x509"
3. Search on Max.gov:  [Max.gov](https://max.gov){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} requires you to log in.  Try searching for the topic or guide.   

If you don't find what you're looking for, open an [Issue]({{site.repourl}}/issues/new){:target="_blank"}.  We can help look through the archives of guides that haven't been posted yet or help you send a request to the government listserves.  

{% include alert-info.html heading="Application integrations using federation protocols" content="We will be migrating the application integration patterns from the Federal ICAM Roadmap and working group documentation—including the use of Security Assertion Markup Language and Open ID Connect—to a set of guides soon!" %}

Your contributions are encouraged and welcome! You can [contribute](https://www.idmanagement.gov/contribute/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to this effort or open an [Issue]({{site.repourl}}/issues/new){:target="_blank"} to discuss a need you may have for a guide.
