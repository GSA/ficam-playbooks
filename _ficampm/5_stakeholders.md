A stakeholder is an individual or organization that has an interest in the program, either because the stakeholder is actively involved in the program or might be affected by the program’s outcome.

This page describes how to work with stakeholders by doing the following:

- [Identify Stakeholders](#identify-stakeholders) - determine the individuals or agencies that will be involved or actively interested in your Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) program. The tables on this page provide a starting point to identify key ICAM stakeholders at the federal and agency levels.

    - [Federal Governance Bodies](#federal-governance-bodies)
    - [Internal Standards Body](#internal-standards-body)
    - [External Service Customers](#external-service-customers)
    - [Agency-Level Stakeholders](#agency-level-stakeholders)
- [Manage Stakeholders](#manage-stakeholders) - establish effective communication and processes among your stakeholders.

## Identify Stakeholders

Stakeholders can be internal or external to the agency. Internal stakeholders may include the program sponsor, steering committee, or governance board, and external stakeholders may include suppliers, investors, community groups, and other government organizations.

To understand the impacts of program decisions, you’ll need to identify all stakeholders for your mission delivery, not just those who may be positively affected by the project.

## Manage Stakeholders

Stakeholder management involves coordination, collaboration, and communication within the agency. Each stakeholder group has a distinct mission requirement and performs duties in support of the overall agency mission. These stakeholders have different viewpoints that may conflict with each other or the overarching ICAM program objectives, and decisions made in one program area may impact another.

To encourage collaboration, develop working groups that comprise stakeholders across the program. Stakeholders in these working groups incorporate their needs into the ICAM program and share implementation lessons learned in other ICAM implementations to reduce overall program risk and increase efficiency in implementation.

You can also stand up smaller focus groups or tiger teams devoted to specific program issues or direct implementation support. You'll promote consistency and stakeholder buy-in by encouraging better understanding, inclusion, and ownership in the program.
