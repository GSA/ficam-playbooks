The easiest way to verify your migration to the Federal Common Policy CA (FCPCA) G2 is to validate one of your PIV credential certificates.

### Verify Migration on Windows

1. Click **Start**, type **certmgr.msc**, and then press **Enter**.
1. Double-click **Personal**, and then **Certificates**.
1. Browse to and select any of the certificates found on your PIV credential (the **Issued To** column displays your name).
1. Double-click the certificate and select the **Certification Path** tab.
1. Verify the certificate chain begins with the **FCPCA G2** (pictured below).
	
	**Note:** It's okay if different certification authorities appear below the FCPCA G2 for your certificate.

2. Double-click the **Keychain Access** icon to open the application.

### Troubleshooting

- If you're building a path to the FCPCA G1
	- [Verify you have distrusted the FCPCA G1](../migrate/#2-distrust-the-federal-common-policy-ca)
- If a path isn't building at all
	- [Verify your distribution of the FCPCA G2](../verify-os-distribution/)
	- [Distribute the CA certificates issued by the FCPCA G2](../certificates/)
