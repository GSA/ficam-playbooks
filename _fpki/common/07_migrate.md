{% include alert-info.html content="<strong>We're calling for all solutions!</strong> If you'd like to share your agency's playbook on how to distrust a CA certificate, create an <a href=\"https://github.com/GSA/ficam-playbooks/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\">issue on GitHub</a> or email us at fpki@gsa.gov." %}

For the purpose of these steps, we refer to the existing Federal Common Policy CA (FCPCA) as *FCPCA G1*.

To migrate from the existing FCPCA G1 to the FCPCA G2 as your agency's federal trust anchor, you'll need to:
1. [**disable enterprise distribution**](#disable-distribution-of-the-fcpca-g1) of the FCPCA G1 as a _trusted root_ CA certificate, and
2. [**distrust**](#distrust-the-fcpca-g1) the FCPCA G1.

{% include alert-warning.html content="<strong>Heads up!</strong> Test the following steps in a controlled environment <strong>before</strong> you deploy them across your enterprise. If you do not successfully distribute the FCPCA G2 certificate before you begin these steps, you may cause a <strong>denial-of-service</strong>, impacting smart card logon for your applications and systems." %}

## Disable Distribution of the FCPCA G1

Reference the distribution mechanisms [here](../distribute-os/) to review the ways the FCPCA certificate **could** be distributed across your enterprise. Disable all existing distribution mechanisms. Sample procedures to disable the distribution of the FCPCA G1 are listed below using:

- [Microsoft Certutil](#if-the-fcpca-was-distributed-using-microsoft-certutil)
- [Microsoft Group Policy Object (GPO)](#if-the-fcpca-was-distributed-using-a-microsoft-gpo)
- [Apple configuration profile (macOS or iOS)](#if-the-fcpca-was-distributed-using-an-apple-configuration-profile)


<br>

### If the FCPCA Was Distributed Using Microsoft Certutil
{% include alert-warning.html content="You must have enterprise administrator privileges for the domain to perform these steps. You must run these commands from an agency domain controller." %}

1. Navigate to **Server Manager**.
1. Select **Tools**.
1. In the drop-down list, select **ADSI Edit**.
1. In the top navication, select **Action > Connect to** .
1. In the **Select a well known Naming Context** drop-down list, select **Configuration**, and click **OK**.
1. Browse to the **CN=AIA** directory (within "CN=Public Key Services, CN=Services"), right-click the entry for the FCPCA, and select **Delete**.
1. Browse to the **CN=Certification Authorities** directory (within "CN=Public Key Services, CN=Services"), right-click the entry for the FCPCA and select **Delete**.

<br>

### If the FCPCA Was Distributed Using a Microsoft GPO
{% include alert-warning.html content="You must have enterprise administrator privileges for the domain to perform these steps. You must run these commands from an agency domain controller." %}

1. Navigate to **Server Manager**.
1. Select **Tools**.
1. Select **Group Policy Management** from the drop-down list.
1. Expand the **Group Policy Objects** directory.
1. Right-click the GPO distributing the FCPCA and select **Delete**.

<br>

### If the FCPCA Was Distributed Using an Apple Configuration Profile
1. Identify how the profile is being distributed across the enterprise (e.g., over-the-air profile delivery or from an MDM server)
2. Use local knowledge to disable the distribution.  If you are having trouble with a specific product, email us at fpkirootupdate@gsa.gov.

<br>

## Distrust the FCPCA G1

Use one of the methods below to distrust the FCPCA G1.
- [Use Microsoft Group Policy Object (GPO)](#use-microsoft-group-policy-object)
- [Use macOS Terminal](#use-macos-terminal)
- [Use Linux Command Line](#use-linux-command-line)

### Use Microsoft Group Policy Object

{% include alert-warning.html content="You must have enterprise administrator privileges for the domain to perform these steps. You must run these commands from an agency domain controller." %}

1. Navigate to **Server Manager**.
1. Select **Tools**.
1. Select **Group Policy Management** from the drop-down list.
1. Right-click your desired domain(s), and select **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here**.
1. Enter a GPO **Name** and click **OK**.
1. Right-click the newly created *Group Policy Object (GPO)* and click **Edit**.
1. Navigate to **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Public Key Policies**.  
1. Right-click **Untrusted Certificates**, and select **Import**. *The Certificate Import Wizard will open*. 
1. Browse to and select your copy of FCPCA G1.
1. Verify that the target **Certificate Store** presents **Untrusted Certificates**, and select **Next**.
1. Select **Finish** to complete the import.

	A success message appears.

1. Close the **Group Policy Management** window.
1. Wait for clients to consume the new policy.
1. (*Optional*) To force client consumption, click **Start**, type **cmd**, press **Enter**, and run the following command:
    ```
          gpupdate /force
    ```
	
Note: The following .gif shows you how to distrust the FCPCA G1 on Microsoft Server 2016.

<br>

### Use macOS Terminal

{% include alert-info.html content="macOS handles certificate distrust differently than Windows does.  The steps below distrust the FCPCA G1 certificate by deleting it from the System and Login Keychains.  The absence of the FCPCA G1 certificate from the Keychains results in the certificate not being trusted by the workstation. Only system administrators should follow these steps." %}

**Note:** Many Mobile Device Management (MDM) platforms allow administrators to push the command below across an enterprise rather than running it on individual workstations. _Use automation wherever possible_.

1. Click the **Spotlight** icon and search for *Terminal*.
2. Double-click the **Terminal** icon (black monitor icon with white “>_”) to open a window.
3. Run the following command:

    ```
	$ sudo security delete-certificate -c "Federal Common Policy CA" /Library/Keychains/System.keychain && sudo security delete-certificate -c "Federal Common Policy CA" login.keychain
    ```

### Use Linux Command Line

#### Debian-Based Kernels

1. Launch the command line.

1. Change directory with the following command:

    ```
        cd /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
    ```

1. Remove your copy of the Federal Common Policy CA certificate with the following commands (assumes name of certificate file is known):

    ```
        sudo rm fcpca.crt
    ```

1. Update Trusted Certificates with the following command:

    ```
        sudo update-ca-certificates
    ```
    
 1. Run the following command to verify the Federal Common Policy CA no longer has an entry in the system’s trust list:

    ```
        trust list | grep "Federal Common Policy CA"
    ```
     


<br>

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and other Non-Debian-Based Kernels

1. Launch the command line.

1. Change directory with the following command:

    ```
        cd /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/

    ```

1. Remove your copy of the Federal Common Policy CA certificate with the following commands (assumes name of certificate file is known):

    ```
        sudo rm fcpca.crt
    ```

1. Update Trusted Certificates with the following command:

    ```
        sudo /bin/update-ca-trust extract
    ```

1. Run the following command to verify the Federal Common Policy CA no longer has an entry in the system’s trust list:

    ```
        trust list | grep "Federal Common Policy CA"
    ```
     

<br>

Finally, [verify migration to the FCPCA G2](../verify-migration/).
