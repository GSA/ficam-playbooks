This is a high-level overview of trust stores (also called *certificate stores*) and a list of commonly used trust stores and settings. 

### What Is a trust store?
There are millions of identity certificates issued to people and devices around the world.  Certificates constantly change as some are revoked and others are issued&mdash;far too many for your computer to maintain an up-to-date list.  

Instead, a trust store (a list of **trusted root certificates**) is maintained.  When you are presented with a person or device certificate from a PIV credential, website, email, or some other digital item, your operating system or application will check to see whether the certificate has a valid path to one of the trusted root certificates in its trust store. The trust store is usually embedded in an operating system or software.

### What Are the Most Commonly Used Trust Stores?
Operating systems, browsers, and some commercial software use trust stores to verify whether a certificate with which you are being presented should be trusted. 

Here are some common trust stores. If the Federal Common Policy CA (FCPCA) (i.e., COMMON) root certificate is included in a trust store and distributed by _default_, the _Includes FCPCA (COMMON)?_ column below will say _Yes_.

### What Federal PKI Certificate Policies Are Trusted by Adobe and How Do I see Them?

A common question is *which certificate policy object identifiers (OIDs) are trusted?* The Federal PKI certificate policy OIDs trusted by Adobe are:

| Certificate Policies | OIDs | Certificate Use |
|:---------------------|:-----|:----------------|
| Common Hardware                               | 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.7  | PIV and Federal Bridge Medium Hardware Token                                      |
| Federal Bridge Medium Hardware Commercial Best Practice | 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.15 | Federal Bridge Medium Hardware Token (PKI Trusted Roles may not be U.S. citizens) |
| Common High                                   | 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.16 | High Assurance Policy                                                             |
| PIV-I Hardware                                | 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.18 | PIV-Interoperable                                                                 |

Federal PKI certificates may be used for digitally signing documents between federal agencies and with business partners.  Adobe is just one option used for digital signatures.

Do the following to see and verify which Federal PKI certificate policy OIDs are trusted by Adobe Acrobat:

  1. Open Adobe Acrobat.  
  1. Select _Edit_ > _Preferences_ > _Signatures_ > _Identities & Trusted Certificates_ > _More_.
  2. Choose _Trusted Certificates_ from the left-hand sidebar.  
  3. Choose _Federal Common Policy CA_ and then the _Certificate Details_ tab.
  3. Choose the _Certificate Viewer_ window, and click the _Policies_ tab to see _Policy Restrictions_. 
  4. In _Certificate Policies_, you will see a comma-separated list of policy OIDs.
