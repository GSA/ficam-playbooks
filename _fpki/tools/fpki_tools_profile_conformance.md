The **Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT)** analyzes certificates for conformance to a specific Federal PKI profile document and certificate profile. In conjunction with the Card Conformance Tool (CCT), the CPCT enables entity representatives to perform testing directly, with results verified by the GSA teams. This can improve the detection of any issues during development and maintenance, and reduce travel and resource time and costs.
