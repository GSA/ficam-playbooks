**Last Update**: April 22, 2021

The **Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT)** supports FPKI annual reviews and compliance by analyzing public X.509 certificates for conformance to a specified FPKI profile:

- Common Policy SSP Program
- FPKI/Federal Bridge
- PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I)

In conjunction with the [Card Conformance Tool (CCT)](../cct), the CPCT enables FPKI stakeholders to perform remote testing. To request an official report on your CPCT and CCT results, fill out the [Annual PIV Credential Issuer (PCI) Testing Application Form](https://www.idmanagement.gov/fpki-annual-card-testing-application/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and send it with outputs and testing artifacts to fips201ep@gsa.gov.

The CPCT can improve the detection of certificate profile issues during FPKI development and maintenance phases.
