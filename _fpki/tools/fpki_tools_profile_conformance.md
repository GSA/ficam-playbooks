The [Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT)](https://cpct.app.cloud.gov/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} is a website application hosted on [Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} that supports FPKI annual reviews and compliance by analyzing public X.509 certificates for conformance to a specified FPKI profile:

- Common Policy SSP Program
- FPKI/Federal Bridge
- PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I)

In conjunction with the [Card Conformance Tool (CCT)]({{site.baseurl}}/fpki/tools/cct), the CPCT enables FPKI stakeholders to perform remote testing. To request an official report on your CPCT and CCT results, fill out the [Annual PIV Credential Issuer (PCI) Testing Application Form](https://www.idmanagement.gov/docs/fips201ep-pcitestform.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and send it with outputs and testing artifacts to fips201ep at gsa.gov.

The CPCT can improve the detection of certificate profile issues during FPKI development and maintenance phases.
