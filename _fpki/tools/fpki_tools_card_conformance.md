You can use the Card Conformance Tool (CCT) to verify that your commercially available Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) cards conform to the PIV data model per current releases of FIPS 201 and related standards.

For more information about the CCT, see the [CCT Wiki](https://github.com/GSA/piv-conformance/wiki). You can [download the latest version of the CCT here](https://github.com/GSA/piv-conformance/releases).
