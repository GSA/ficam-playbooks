The Card Conformance Tool (CCT) is a GSA managed, Java tool that can verify that a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) conforms to the PIV data model per current releases of related standards, including:

- [FIPS 201](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/201/2/final){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: PIV of Federal Employees and Contractors
- [NIST SP 800-73](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-73/4/final){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification
- [NIST SP 800-76](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-76/2/final){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification
- [NIST SP 800-78](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-78/4/final){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification

The CCT, in conjunction with the [Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT)](../cpct), also facilitates remote PIV and PIV-I testing in support of FPKI [annual reviews](https://www.idmanagement.gov/community/fpki-cas-audit-info/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, reducing travel and resource time and costs. To request an official report on your CPCT and CCT results, fill out the [Annual PIV Credential Issuer (PCI) Testing Application Form](https://www.idmanagement.gov/fpki-annual-card-testing-application/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and send it with outputs and testing artifacts to fips201ep@gsa.gov.

For more information about the CCT, see the [CCT Wiki](https://github.com/GSA/piv-conformance/wiki). You can [download the latest version of the CCT here](https://github.com/GSA/piv-conformance/releases).
