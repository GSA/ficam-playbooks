You can use the Card Conformance Tool (CCT) to verify that your Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) cards conform to the PIV data model per current releases of FIPS 201 and related standards, including:

- FIPS 201: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors
- NIST SP 800-73: Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification
- NIST SP 800-76: Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification
- NIST SP 800-78: Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification

The CCT facilitates remote PIV and PIV-I testing in support of FPKI [annual reviews](https://www.idmanagement.gov/community/fpki-cas-audit-info/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. To generate the proper testing artifacts, fill out the [Annual PIV Credential Issuer (PCI) Testing Application Form](https://www.idmanagement.gov/fpki-annual-card-testing-application/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and send it to fips201ep@gsa.gov.

For more information about the CCT, see the [CCT Wiki](https://github.com/GSA/piv-conformance/wiki). You can [download the latest version of the CCT here](https://github.com/GSA/piv-conformance/releases).
