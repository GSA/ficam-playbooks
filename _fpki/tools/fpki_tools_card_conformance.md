The Card Conformance Tool (CCT) can verify that a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) conforms to the PIV data model per current releases of related standards, including:

- [FIPS 201](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/201/2/final){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: PIV of Federal Employees and Contractors
- [NIST SP 800-73](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-73/4/final){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification
- [NIST SP 800-76](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-76/2/final){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification
- [NIST SP 800-78](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-78/4/final){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification

The CCT also facilitates remote PIV and PIV-I testing in support of FPKI [annual reviews](https://www.idmanagement.gov/community/fpki-cas-audit-info/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. To request an official report on your CCT results, fill out the [Annual PIV Credential Issuer (PCI) Testing Application Form](https://www.idmanagement.gov/fpki-annual-card-testing-application/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and send it with testing artifacts to fips201ep@gsa.gov.
