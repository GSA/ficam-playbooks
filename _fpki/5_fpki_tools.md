We are always collecting useful tools and links that will help you understand and use the Federal Public Key Infrastructure. The table below provides a list of useful tools.

Please consider contributing any of your favorite tools to this effort!

**Tool** | **Link** | **Purpose/Use** | **Audience**
--- | :---: | --- | ---
FPKI Graph | [FPKI Graph](fpkigraph) | This is an interactive website that is updated weekly to display the hundreds of certification authorities that make up the FPKI and how they are connected. | Program Managers; System Engineers
Card Conformance Tool (CCT) | [GitHub (External)](https://github.com/GSA/piv-conformance/releases){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} | The [Card Conformance Tool (CCT)](cct) is a GSA managed Java tool which validates that Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) smart cards are compliant with key standards. | PIV or PIV-I Issuers; System Engineers
Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT) | [Cert Conformance Tool (External)](https://cpct.app.cloud.gov/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} | The [Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT)](cpct) is a web site application that analyzes certificates for conformance to a specified FPKI-defined profile. | FPKI Certificate Issuers or Relying Parties; System Engineers
Certutil | [MSDN (External)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} |  Certutil.exe is a Microsoft Windows command-line utility that provides many uses, including exporting PIV certificates and validating certificates |  System Engineers
Personal Identify Verification (PIV) Cert Validator Tool | [Max.gov PIV Tool (External)](https://pv.test.max.gov/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} | The PIV Certificate Validator is a website application hosted by Max.gov. It assists in verifying the certificates found on a PIV card. | System Engineers
PKI Interoperability Test Tool (PITT) for Microsoft Windows | [Sourceforge (External)](http://pkif.sourceforge.net/pitt.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} | The PKI Interoperability Test Tool (PITT) is a utility intended for PKI integrators. It allows inspection and troubleshooting of certification path processing for a given PKI using both PKIF and Microsoft CAPI. Itâ€™s especially useful for identifying a portion of your PKI that may be causing performance problems. | System Engineers
FPKI CRL Miner | [GitHub (External)](https://github.com/grandamp/CRLMiner){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} | A work in progress Open Source GitHub repository to validate all HTTP CRL URLs for the Federal PKI. | System Engineers 
crt.sh | [External](https://crt.sh/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} | Certificate Transparency auditor used to find and audit TLS certificate issuances and issues. | System Engineers
OpenSC | [Github (External)](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} | OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Use OpenSC versions of 0.20.0 or greater to reduce website authentication errors related to TLS 1.3. | System Engineers
NIST 85B (800-73-4) Test Tool | [NIST (External)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/nist-personal-identity-verification-program/software-downloads){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} | Used to pull deep PIV contents when integrating PIV with various infrastructure components. | System Engineers; FPKI Card Issuers
