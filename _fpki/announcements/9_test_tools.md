GSA has created two tools to streamline Federal PKI Annual Review testing by offering a remote evaluation capability:

-	Card Conformance Tool (CCT) - validates that Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) smart cards are compliant with key standards.
-	Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT) - analyzes certificates for conformance to a specific Federal PKI profile document and certificate profile.
  
The tools allow testing to be performed directly by entity representatives, with results verified by the GSA teams. Benefits include:
-	Preemptive identification of possible issues during development and maintenance; and 
-	Reduction in travel and related resource time costs.

For more information, see the following web sites:
