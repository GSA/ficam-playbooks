GSA has created two tools to streamline Federal PKI Annual Review testing with remote evaluation capabilities.

-	**Card Conformance Tool (CCT)** - validates that Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) smart cards are compliant with key standards.
-	**Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT)** - analyzes certificates for conformance to a specific Federal PKI profile document and certificate profile.
  
The tools enable entity representatives to perform testing directly, with results verified by the GSA teams. Benefits include:
-	Preemptive identification of possible issues during development and maintenance, and 
-	Reduction in travel and related resource time costs.
