Federal employees and contractors often need to access protected services managed by other federal agencies. Federation is the means by which an agency can accept authentication assertions and associated identity attributes from systems within their agency and at other agencies. This allows federal employees and contractors from across agencies to access protected resources and streamlines the user’s experience.
  
Agencies can pass assertions to share attributes about employees and contractors.

---

## Use Case

In this use case, an employee or contractor from Agency A attempts to access a federated service at Agency B. This use case assumes the employee or contractor already has an account or entitlements to access resources at Agency B, or that they will be provisioned.

For more information about granting access to protected resources, see [Grant Access](../grantaccess).

## Examples

- I want to allow other federal agencies' employees and contractors (who meet specific requirements) to access some of my agency’s resources, which facilitates cross-government collaboration and information sharing.
- An employee or contractor from Agency A visits a shared service operated by Agency B to service all federal government users. At the homepage, the employee/contractor selects their Agency A icon and is redirected to their Agency A SSO portal. They log in using their Agency A managed credentials and are redirected back to the Agency B shared service.
