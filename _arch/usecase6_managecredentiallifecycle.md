Active credentials require regular maintenance. This use case describes the most common credential maintenance activities:

- **[Reset a credential](#reset-a-credential)** - An employee or contractor forgets the password or PIN associated with a credential and requests a reset.
- **[Renew a credential](#renew-a-credential)** - An employee or contractor’s credential is expiring or their identity information changes, so they request a replacement credential. You must renew a credential prior to the expiration date; otherwise, the employee or contractor must go through the issuance process again.
- **[Revoke a credential](#revoke-a-credential)** - An employee or contractor is no longer eligible for their credential (like separating from the issuing agency). The sponsor, supervisor, or administrator requests a revocation of all associated credentials and enterprise accounts.

You should periodically review your employee or contractors’ eligibility for credentials to identify potential orphaned data.

### Reset a Credential

In this use case, an administrator needs to reset a password or PIN for an employee or contractor credential.

}

</style>

    <td style="border:0px;">The employee or contractor resets their password or PIN.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Renew a Credential

In this use case, an administrator needs to issue a new credential to replace one that will expire soon or has outdated identity information.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="width:250px;border:0px;"><strong>1. Initiate the request</strong> <br> <a href="../../assets/arch/usecases/6-Renew-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../assets/arch/usecases/6-Renew-1.png" width="250" alt="A diagram showing an employee or contractor initiating a credential renewal request to an enterprise identity management system."></a></td>
    <td style="border:0px;">An individual requests a renewal for an employee or contractor’s credential.<br><br>This individual may be the employee or contractor, their supervisor, or an administrator with approval authority.<br><br>This could also be an automated process triggered by schedules or specific events.</td>

    <td style="border:0px;">The identity management system reviews the request and verifies that the employee or contractor qualifies for a renewed credential. If so, approve the request.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="width:250px;border:0px;"><strong>3. Replace the credential</strong> <br> <a href="../../assets/arch/usecases/6-Renew-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../assets/arch/usecases/6-Renew-3.png" width="250" alt="A diagram showing an enterprise identity management system issueing a new credential to an employee or contracter."></a></td>
    <td style="border:0px;">The system issues a new credential to the employee or contractor and updates the associated enterprise identity record.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Revoke a Credential

In this use case, an administrator needs to revoke an active credential.

  <tr>
    <td style="width:250px;border:0px;"><strong>1. Initiate the request</strong> <br> <a href="../../assets/arch/usecases/6-Revoke-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../assets/arch/usecases/6-Revoke-1.png" width="250" alt="A diagram showing an employee or contractor or a sponsor or supervisor initiating a credential revocation request to an enterprise identity management system."></a></td>
    <td style="border:0px;">An individual sends a separation notification or a notice of a lost or compromised credential, requesting revocation.<br><br>This individual may be the employee or contractor, their supervisor, HR, or a security team member.</td>

    <td style="border:0px;">The administrator invalidates the credential.<br/>Depending on your agency, an individual or a system may perform this task. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="width:250px;border:0px;"><strong>3. Return the credential</strong> <br> <a href="../../assets/arch/usecases/6-Revoke-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../assets/arch/usecases/6-Revoke-3.png" width="250" alt="A diagram showing an administrator returning the invalidated hardware or physical credential to the supervisor or sponsor."></a></td>
    <td style="border:0px;">If the revoked credential is physical or hardware-based, the administrator returns the credential to the appropriate individual.<br><br>This individual may be a supervisor, HR, or security team member.</td>

## Examples

- An employee or contractor may have attempted to use a credential and input the PIN information incorrectly several times up to an agency-defined limit and has locked their account or credential.  The employee or contractor requests a PIN reset.  The employee or contractor is directed to an unlock service; has to verify information again to prove they are the same person issued the original credential; and follows prompts to unlock their credential, generating a new PIN in the process.
- *Reset* - I want to verify the identity of an employee or contractor that has already been issued a credential and reset their PIN or password so that they can continue to access enterprise resources.
- *Renew* - I want to verify the identity and eligibility of an employee or contractor, who has a previously issued credential that is near expiration, so that they may be issued a new enterprise credential to maintain their ability to access enterprise resources.
- *Revoke* - I want to remove access to enterprise resources for an employee or contractor so that they can no longer use the protected resource.
