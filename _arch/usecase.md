These use cases are designed for ICAM Enterprise Architects and business owners and describe some of the most common ICAM business processes.

Each use case includes a high-level summary of the scenario, individuals and systems involved in the use case, illustrations that show the required steps to achieve the end goal, and an icon that indicates the practice area and the service with which the use case most closely aligns.

For details about ICAM services, see the [Services Framework]({{site.baseurl}}/arch/services).

While each use case describes a particular ICAM business process, the use cases are all interrelated. The use cases generalize the activities and technologies to make sure they apply across many agencies. The use cases don’t include agency-specific functions and process details because your agency should analyze your systems and processes to align with these broad use cases.

You can combine or build upon the ICAM use cases to support your agency’s scenarios and needs.

    <p>When you onboard an employee or contractor at your agency, you collect identity information from the individual and store parts of that information as identity attributes. These attributes serve as a digital proxy for the individual’s identity, also known as an enterprise identity.</p>

    <p>In this use case, an administrator needs to collect or manage identity data for an employee or contractor for the purpose of creating an enterprise identity record and maintaining it throughout its lifecycle.</p>

    <p>Before you can create a credential and assign it to an individual, that person must provide proof of their claimed identity. Identity proofing is the process by which a federal agency collects and verifies information about a person to establish an enterprise identity.</p>
    <p>The location or information that a person needs to access informs the Identity Assurance Level (IAL), which determines the elements you should require from that person for identity proofing. There are three IALs; however, federal agencies require a minimum of IAL2 for employees or contractors with recurring access to government resources, so these use cases do not include IAL1.</p>
    <p>This use case describes the high-level steps to proof an identity at IAL2 or IAL3. Depending on the required IAL, you may require increasingly more information from an employee or contractor or partner along with additional verification steps. The information provided by the employee or contractor is also known as identity evidence. Identity evidence may be physical, such as passports, driver’s licenses, and birth certificates.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IAL2</strong> - first and last name, email address, and address of record, supported by appropriate identity documentation and verified as strong.</li>
      <li><strong>IAL3</strong> - first and last name, email address, address of record, and fingerprints, supported by appropriate identity documentation and verified as superior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>
    <p>In this use case, an Access Control System (ACS) Administrator needs to grant access to an employee or contractor who has an enterprise identity and active credential and needs to access a logical or physical resource. These steps assume the employee or contractor already has credentials to support authentication as well as the access entitlements to support authorization decisions.</p>

      <li><em>Authentication</em> - I want to verify the claimed unique identity of a given employee or contractor  so that the system can verify the right individual is attempting to access an agency service.</li>
      <li><em>Authorization</em> - I want to allow access for only employees and contractors that meet established requirements so that only the people who should have access do have access.</li>

    <p>An employee on the financial review team attempts to access a government financial application that is secured by a single sign-on (SSO) solution. The employee clicks a link to the financial application and is redirected to the SSO portal. The employee authenticates using his/her provided credential, which the SSO determines to be valid. The SSO solution or the financial application system finds the employee’s enterprise identity account and compares the roles assigned to those allowed by the financial application. The resulting determination is that the employee has authenticated to the required assurance level and has the appropriate entitlements to access the system and is subsequently logged on.</p><br>

    <p>Federal employees and contractors often need to access protected services managed by other federal agencies. Federation is the means by which an agency can accept authentication assertions and associated identity attributes from systems within their agency and at other agencies. This allows federal employees and contractors from across agencies to access protected resources and streamlines the user’s experience.</p>
    <p>Agencies can pass assertions to share attributes about employees and contractors.</p>

    <p>In this use case, an employee or contractor from Agency A attempts to access a federated service at Agency B. This use case assumes the employee or contractor already has an account or entitlements to access resources at Agency B, or that they will be provisioned.</p>
